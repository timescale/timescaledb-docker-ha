services:
  # Include this service if you need to interface with Docker from the build container.
  #
  # Any other "services" which you might need from the CI system can be added here. They will be
  # spun-up as new containers in the job's pod and will be accessible over the localhost network.

# Gitlab CI stages define the general structure of any possible build job. For every job executed,
# the stages will be triggered in order, executing any jobs defined for the respective stage.
#
# **THIS DOES NOT DEFINE THE ACTUAL PIPELINE.** The pipeline is composed of the stages defined
# here combined with the jobs defined below (a job is any YAML section below which contains the
# `script` keyword). Pipelines are formed by creating jobs which are executed as part
# of specific stages.
stages:
  - build
  - tests.system
  - tests.load
  - release

variables:
  # Use an allegedly faster FS option for docker builds.
  DOCKER_DRIVER: "overlay2"
  # Point to the `docker:stable-dind` service defined above.
  DOCKER_HOST: "tcp://localhost:2375"
  # The Docker Registry to which to push
  REGISTRY: ${CI_REGISTRY}
  # This is injected into the Docker image to have some traceability to its build context
  GIT_AUTHOR: GitLab CI/CD
  # The image tag to use for this CI pipeline's build. This is used by deployments.
  TAG: ${CI_PIPELINE_ID}
  # The name of the K8s ImagePullSecret to use for this project.
