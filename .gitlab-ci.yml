services:
  # Include this service if you need to interface with Docker from the build container.
  #
  # Any other "services" which you might need from the CI system can be added here. They will be
  # spun-up as new containers in the job's pod and will be accessible over the localhost network.

# Gitlab CI stages define the general structure of any possible build job. For every job executed,
# the stages will be triggered in order, executing any jobs defined for the respective stage.
#
# **THIS DOES NOT DEFINE THE ACTUAL PIPELINE.** The pipeline is composed of the stages defined
# here combined with the jobs defined below (a job is any YAML section below which contains the
# `script` keyword). Pipelines are formed by creating jobs which are executed as part
# of specific stages.
stages:
  - builder
  - build
  - tests.system
  - tests.load
  - release
  - publish
