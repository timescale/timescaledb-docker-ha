# This takes the requested toolkit and promscale extensions, figures out what versions of cargo-pgx those
# versions want, and then build from the oldest pgx to the newest so that `cargo install cargo-pgx --version`
# commands are only ran once. Once cargo-pgx has been installed, run the installation for the extensions,
# and then continue through the next cargo-pgx version. At the end, we're left with the latest version of
# cargo-pgx so that the builder image can be used to test master/main branches.

# we use the following variables to decide on if/what to install:
# - PROMSCALE_VERSIONS
# - TOOLKIT_VERSIONS
