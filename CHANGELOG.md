## [v0.2.0] - 2019-08-30

### Added
 * Allow PostgreSQL compile time customizations to be made.

  Some environments benefit from being able to change things like `NAMEDATALEN`.
 * Makefile to aid in building the Docker image
 * Gitlab CI/CD configuration to trigger automated builds
 * Entrypoint for `pgBackRest`
 * The TimescaleDB extension is added to the `template1` and `postgres` database
 * Git context is injected into the Docker image

### Changed
 * Default entrypoint is `docker_entrypoint.sh`.

  This enables the Docker image to also be used in a non-kubernetes environment, allowing
  developers to run the exact same software as production environments.

 * Default Docker repository names
 * Failure of first backup does not fail the database initialization

### Removed
 * Removed many packages to reduce Docker image size without breaking TimescaleDB

### Fixed
 * Only configure a Patroni namespace if a `POD_NAMESPACE`



## [v0.1.0] - 2019-08-30
This is the first stable release of the TimescaleDB HA Docker image.
It was built from the [TimescaleDB Operator](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-operator/tree/v0.1.0) before
this repository was split away from it.

### Added
 * A Docker image based on Debian buster

 The basic components of the Docker image are:
  * [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb), all recent releases
  * [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres)
  * [Patroni](https://github.com/zalando/patroni)
  * [pgBackRest](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest)

This Docker image can be used in the same way as the (smaller) public
[TimescaleDB Docker](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-docker) image,
however this image has HA built in, which leverages Patroni to do
auto failover of PostgreSQL if needed.
