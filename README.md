# TimescaleDB Docker image for Kubernetes

This directory contains everything that allows us to create a Docker image with the following pieces of software:

- PostgreSQL
- Some PostgreSQL extensions, most notably PostGIS
- TimescaleDB, multiple versions
- pgBackRest
- scripts to make it all work in a Kubernetes Context

Currently, our base image is Ubuntu, as we require glibc 2.33+.

It's currently pushing the resulting images to: https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/timescaledb-ha

## Build images

To build an image, run the following make target:

```console
make
```

As building the whole image takes considerably amounts of time, the default will only install 1 timescaledb version:
The head of the `master` branch of the github.com/timescale/timescaledb.

For more robust build runs do:

```console
make build
```

Or, if you only want to exclude Timescale License code you can use the following command:

```console
make build-oss
```

> For more information about licensing, please read our [blog post](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/how-we-are-building-an-open-source-business-a7701516a480/) about the subject.

By default, the Docker image contains many extensions, including [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) and [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/).
You can override which version of the extensions are built by setting environment variables, some examples:

```console
# Build without any PostGIS
POSTGIS_VERSIONS="" make build
```

For further environment variables that can be set, we point you to the [Makefile](Makefile) itself.

## Verify your work

For every pushed commit to this repository, a Docker Image will be built and is available at a private
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

### Find the image tag for your commit

> Replace *** with the AWS Account ID.

Once your commit is pushed, a Docker Image will be built, and if successful, will be pushed.
The tag of this Docker Image will be `cicd-<first 8 chars of commit sha>`, for example, for commit `baddcafe...`, the tag will look like:

```text
***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/timescaledb-ha:cicd-deadbeef
```

#### Find out tag using commandline

Assuming your current working directory is on the same commit as the one you pushed

```console
echo "***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/timescaledb-ha:cicd-$(git rev-parse HEAD | cut -c 1-8)"
```

#### Find tag using GitHub Web interface

- Actions
- Click on the **Build Image** Workflow for your commit/branch
- Expand **List docker Images**

##### Example output

```console
Run make list-images
docker images --filter [...]
REPOSITORY                                           TAG             IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/timescaledb-ha   cicd-d20dc5c5   2c81b58b4a59   54 seconds ago   1.06GB
```

In the above example, your Docker tag is `cicd-d20dc5c5` and your full image url is:

```text
***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/timescaledb-ha:cicd-d20dc5c5
```

## Test your Docker Image

```console
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin ***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker run --rm -ti -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=smoketest ***.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/timescaledb-ha:cicd-baddcafe
```

## Versioning and Releases

### Release Process

Between releases we keep track of notable changes in CHANGELOG.md.

When we want to make a release we should update CHANGELOG.md to contain the release notes for the planned release in a section for
the proposed release number. This update is the commit that will be tagged with as the actual release which ensures that each release
contains a copy of it's own release notes.

We should also copy the release notes to the Github releases page, but CHANGELOG.md is the primary place to keep the release notes.

The release commit should be tagged with a signed tag:

```console
git tag -s vx.x.x
git push --tags
```

If you use the release notes in the tag commit message and it will automatically appear in the Github release. On the Github releases
page click `Draft a new release` and then type your tag in the drop down contain `@master`. The release will automatically be created
using the tag commit text.

### Publish the images to Docker Hub and other registries

Only if you push a tag starting with `v`, for example: `v0.8.3` to the GitHub repository, will new images will be published to docker hub automatically.

They will be written under quite a few aliases, for example, for PostgreSQL 12.6 and Timescale 2.0.1, the following images will be built and pushed/overwritten:

- timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg12-latest
- timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg12-ts2.0-latest
- timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg12.6-ts2.0-latest
- timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg12.6-ts2.0.1-latest

> the `-latest` suffix here indicates the latest docker build, not the latest commit. In particular, images built from a tag will be published with the `-latest` suffix in addition to the tag-based suffix.

In addition, for every build, an immutable image will be created and pushed, which will carry a patch version at the end. These are most suited for production releases, for example:

- timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg12.6-ts2.0.1-p0
