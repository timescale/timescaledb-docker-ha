## The purpose of this Dockerfile is to build an image that contains:
## - timescale from (internal) sources
## - patroni for High Availability
## - spilo to allow the github.com/zalando/postgres-operator to be compatible
## - pgBackRest to allow good backups

## We have many base images to choose from, (alpine, bitnami) but as we're adding a lot
## of tools to the image anyway, the end result is that we would only
## reduce the final Docker image by single digit MB's, which is insignificant
## in relation to the total image size.
## By choosing a very basic base image, we do keep full control over every part
## of the build steps. This Dockerfile contains every piece of magic we want.
